6 years ago, I started Hack Club when I was 16 after dropping out of high school. The finances of other nonprofits was a mystery to me. How did other organizations get donations? How did they spend their money? How much does it cost to run a program that reaches 1,000 people? How much is normal for a monthly salary? How much do laywers and CPAs cost?

Nonprofits are extremely secretive about how their money actually works because it plays to their advantage: the culture is such that major donations are seen as a zero-sum game and that every organization - regardless of their space - is competing with every other org. To share how you do things is to put yourself at a disadvantage.

Since it’s impossible to learn from what other organizations are doing, this results in is a world where you have to be born into a high-priest class to successfully start a nonprofit and receive major gifts. You have to be born into the right family, go to the right private schools, go to the right Ivy League university, and have the right adult friends to not only to have connections to get started, but to simply see how running a nonprofit is actually done.

Hack Club is of course first and foremost about building a generation of hackers, but I've always had a secondary goal of building what I hope to be a model nonprofit: one that is product-first, transparent in its code, finances, and operations, and one that treats its staff well.

Inspired by https://drewdevault.com/2020/05/15/Status-update.html, I wanted to make a snapshot of Hack Club's spending in May 2020. While I don't want to commit to doing these moving forward, this is something that I wish other nonprofits did when Hack Club was first getting started.

This was calculated from HQ's export from Hack Club Bank. You can see our full current account at https://bank.hackclub.com/hq/ using Hack Club Bank's new [Transparency Mode](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1262471150963130374).

I've done my best to include as many committed transactions that have not yet hit our accounts at the bottom of the expense breakdown, including [Elon Musk's $500K gift to Hack Club](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1263153557945159680).

Without further ado, here's a financial snapshot for Hack Club in May 2020:

### Revenue (total $20,621.78)

- **Donations ($15,621.78)**
  - $15,000 - Ron Conway
  - $244.20 - Samuel Escapa

### Expenses ($61,729.35 - nearly entirely salaries)

- **People including taxes ($57,625.25)**

  _For the first time, Hack Club staff is growing beyond 3 people. When we were still tiny, we all took essentially the same salary of $4K/month. Now that we're growing, we still need to figure out how we want to think about salaries as an organization._

    - Note: Melody is paid $4K/month. I've been paying them weekly out of my personal bank account and getting reimbursed by Hack Club. Not all the reimbursements for May have gone through yet, which is why this number is $2K instead of $4K.

The above numbers are on a cash basis, meaning they only include transactions that hit our bank account or cards this month. In some cases, there are expenses that we have committed to in May that have not yet hit our accounts, like rent for the space that the team is currently staying in. I’ve done my best to list all known missing transactions below:

- $500,000 donation from Elon Musk
- $5,000 in rent for May 17th - June 14th (4 weeks) for team in Vermont
- $1,800 paid to Melody for work done in April and March 2020 (I paid them at the time from my personal account and have not been reimbursed yet)
- $3,670 paid to Lewis Mudge for rent the 2nd 1/2 April and the first 1/2 of May (place Max and I stayed in). Similarly, I paid Lewis at the time from my personal account and have not yet been reimbursed.
- ~$100 gas for staff trip to Vermont

Please note: there may be errors in this post. While I have pulled the numbers directly from Hack Club Bank, I did mess around a bit in a spreadsheet and have not double checked my work. I believe that all numbers below are approximately correct.

If you're interested in seeing the Google Sheet I used to calculate the above numbers, you can see it at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UDw7YewsS5wJIVm0Uh5wOGlM2Ddv-kZVrD3QqIypvRQ/edit.

Please note that while the above encompasses all of HQ's spending in our Hack Club Bank account, it does not include GitHub grants to clubs, postage bought by Mail Team, or grants made from our internal "Discretionary Fund" to students in need that is funded by Ron Conway.

_Thanks to Christina, Melody, and Lachlan for their help writing this post._
